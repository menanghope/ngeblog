Community Advertising
=====================

As part of our `ethical advertising`_ model,
Read the Docs **gives away** 10% of our ad inventory
to projects, conferences, and other initiatives in the open source community.
Many of these projects operate as Read the Docs did in the past with little to no income.
These are not groups that traditionally have the resources to use paid advertising.

We have run ads for:

* Various Python conferences from `PyCon`_ to smaller regional conferences
* Many topic or framework specific conferences such as `Djangocon US`_ and `Sustain`_
* `Python Software Foundation`_
* `Mozilla`_
* `Beeware`_ - tools and libraries for building native apps in Python
* `Godot`_ - an open source game engine
* `Kiwi TCMS`_ - an open source test case management system
* `World Possible`_ - an education non-profit
* `Write the Docs`_ - a series of events for documentatarians


Get in touch. We can help!
--------------------------

If you run a conference, non-profit, or a funding strapped open source project,
we would love to help you get the word out.
Make sure you qualify for our `community ads`_ and `send us an email`_
to be considered for the program.

If you have any feedback about our community advertising program,
we'd love to hear from you too.
