Read the Docs is hiring for multiple positions
==============================================

Read the Docs received a :doc:`grant to support scientific software</czi-grant-announcement>` at the beginning of this year.
As part of this,
we are hiring for two new positions related to the grant work:

* A :doc:`frontend developer with design skills </job-frontend>`
* A :doc:`developer advocate with documentation skills </job-devrel>` (**This position has been filled, and is no longer active**)

Please look at each of the job postings for much more detail on what to expect with the job.

We are excited to be able to expand our small team and increase the support we're giving to the scientific open source community.
Throughout 2021 we are going to be vastly improving our documentation and building major new features around embedding documentation content,
based on the work from this grant.

How hiring will be structured
-----------------------------

The way we are currently planning to structure this work is to have 50% of the time spent working on grant work,
and the other 50% working on Read the Docs itself.
The codebase and community we're building require a good amount of onboarding time,
so we are excited to be able to use the grant funds to also improve the overall experience of Read the Docs users.

You can apply to the jobs with the links above to the full job descriptions,
where you will be asked to fill out a form with a few questions.

About Read the Docs
-------------------

Read the Docs is a large open source project providing documentation building and hosting.
You can think of it a continuous integration for docs.
We do around 500 million pageviews each year.
We are a small team,
but **this role will have a large impact of millions of users.**
Almost all of our codebase is open source
and we feel strongly about supporting the community while sustaining the project in an ethical manner.
